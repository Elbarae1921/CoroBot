# CoroStats
My first discord bot

Basically a bot that fetches covid-19 stats from the worldometers.com/coronavirus website.



<h3>Commands example</h3>

Returns an embedded message with covid-19 stats worldwide <pre>?corona stats</pre>
Returns an embedded message with covid-19 stats in <country> <pre>?corona stats <country></pre>

<br/><br/>


The bot might stop functionning correctly if the website got redesigned, it already did many times, but it doesn't take much to get it back up and running.

Definitely not the best bot out there for this kind of thing, but it gets the job done :)
