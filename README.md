# CoroStats
My first discord bot

Basically a bot that fetches covid-19 stats from the worldometers.com/coronavirus website.

Might need some fine tuning in order to get working on your server, since I have hard coded the server ID, in other words you'll have to put your desired server's ID in the SERVER_ID variable in the bot.js file.

Definitely not the best bot out there for this kind of thing, but it gets the job done :)
